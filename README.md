# cl-browser
[W.I.P] Web browser works on CL and supports HTML

This is a hobby project. I am implementing a browser to understand how html and css rendering works.
I've created a list of tasks to follow

- [x] Parse HTML4 ( I could use 'DOMParser' object but chose to create my own )
- [ ] Render HTML4
- [ ] Parse CSS 2.1
- [ ] Render CSS 2.1
